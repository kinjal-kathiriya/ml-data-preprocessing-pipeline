## 📊 ML Data Preprocessing Pipeline
A complete end-to-end data preprocessing and exploratory analysis workflow.
This project focuses on cleaning raw data, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, visualizing distributions, and preparing the dataset for machine learning models.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a practical data preprocessing pipeline commonly used in Machine Learning and Data Science workflows.
It turns raw structured data into a clean, validated, and well-organized dataset suitable for training ML models.
Key steps include:
Loading and inspecting the dataset
Handling missing and inconsistent values
Converting data types
Detecting and removing outliers
Normalizing and scaling numerical values
Encoding categorical variables
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizing key insights
Exporting processed data for modeling
